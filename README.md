# ASCIIEnum(Const)

An ASCII character table for C#, enumerate the ASCII characters.

It's a static class with 128 constant declarations in it.

```
public static class ASCIIEnum
{
    public const char NUL = '\x00';
    public const char SOH = '\x01';
    public const char STX = '\x02';
    public const char ETX = '\x03';
    ......
}
```

It is out-of-the-box. What you need is to copy the file or all of the characters to your project.
